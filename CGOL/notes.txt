New project idea:
  Conway's Game of Life

  Without using graphics, we could have a 8x8(potentially) grid of 1's and 0's.
  The grid could be a two-dimentional array. Every step of the program, we could
  loop through each pixel and apply the rules individually. To prevent problems of
  the array changing itself throught the program, we can duplicate the array. This
  duplicate will be the one we apply the rules to. We get the current state of a cell
  from the main array, apply the rules, and then write it to the duplicate. When we're
  done will all the pixels, we set the main array = to the duplicate and write the output.
