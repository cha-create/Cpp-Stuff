Conway's Game of Life.
This is a simulation I wrote for CGOL implemented in C++. It's not perfect but it will allow you to make gliders and stuff, so good enough
for me. You can use any tool to build it because it's just a standard C++ file. I used G++ from the GNU compiler and it works like a charm.
Have fun!
